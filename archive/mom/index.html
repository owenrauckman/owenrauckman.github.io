    <h1>Julia's Cancer Story</h1>
    <p><b>The Short Story:</b>  On July 5, I was diagnosed with Triple Negative Breast Cancer which has metastasized to the right lung and into the lymph nodes in my right arm and parts of my chest.  Since it is now in my lung, which is a major organ, there is no cure and it is terminal.  It is still considered “metastatic breast cancer,” not lung or lymph cancer, because of the place of origin.</p>
    <p><b>The Long Story:</b>  On June 8, I had a revision surgery by a plastic surgeon to basically “clean up the mess” from my bilateral mastectomy in November.  Because of medical coding and insurance, the breast cancer surgeon had just removed all of the breast tissue and sewed it back up.  As I healed, what was left shifted to other places and as a result I felt like there was a tennis ball under each arm. A void left from surgery filled with fluid and formed a seroma, which was very painful.  It was also very uncomfortable to wear prosthetics (I was not a candidate for reconstruction because of the high probability of cancer recurrence).  I had a consult with a plastic surgeon who assured me that he could smooth things out, drain the fluid, and improve my comfort level, and he did.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, even though the June surgery itself went well, I developed atelectasis (where parts of the lung collapsed) and pneumonia from trauma to the lung during anesthesia.  Basically, the shallow breathing induced while under anesthesia can cause “sticky lung” where your lungs don’t fully inflate. I ran a low-grade fever for several days and felt very fatigued.  I followed up with the plastic surgeon, who advised me to see my primary care doctor.</p>
    <p>My primary care doctor ordered a chest x-ray which showed atelectasis, pneumonia, and some scarring to the lungs.  He gave me a round of Levaquin and I felt better within a few days.   I had a follow-up appointment 2 weeks later, and had another chest x-ray.  This time the doctor noticed a small shape on the right lung which concerned him.  The radiologist examined the x-ray and thought it might be a pulmonary nodule, and with my past history, he recommended a CT scan with contrast dye through an IV.  The dye has sugar in it and it goes straight to any cancer cells because cancer loves sugar.</p>
    <p>At this point I called my medical oncologist, Dr. Graff (chemo doc) who is the uber-manager of my case.  I knew she could fast-track my CT scan appointment
and she did.  (With my past history, waiting for tests and results is unbearable). I had my CT scan on July 3 at Menorah Medical Center, celebrated the 4th of July the next day, and then went on July 5 for a follow-up appointment with Dr. Graff.</p>
    <p>I had also just begun a very promising clinical study for Triple Negative Breast Cancer which is developing a new approach by using vaccinations to make cancer <b>stay</b> away after treatment.  (Most other types of breast cancer have a follow-up medicine for five years after treatment to prevent recurrence, but this is just now happening for Triple Negative cancer studies and it will be several years before this could become protocol, if it proves successful). So, this was my second month of the study, and I had to get several vials of blood drawn before getting my Tap-Immune vaccination while I was there in the office.  I knew something was wrong when the nurse did not give me my vaccination.  She said Dr. Graff wanted to see me first.</p>
    <p>I sat in the little office by myself and waited.  Dr. Graff came in, looked me straight in the eye, and said that the CT scan showed that the cancer had recurred.  It had spread to the right lung and lymph nodes in my right arm and chest.  It is possible that the cancer cells had been there the whole time during treatment last summer and fall, or might have started developing this spring.  (Some cells are too tiny to see during scans and ultrasounds).  Triple Negative Breast Cancer is very aggressive and fast-growing. Once it has moved to an organ, it is terminal.  It can sometimes be treated, but it will never go away.</p>
    <p>The next day, July 6, on my 54th birthday, I returned to Dr. Graff for another visit.  Kelly was with me this time, and we wanted to hear the diagnosis again together and make sure we understood all the information.  We wanted to understand what we could do next.</p>
    <p>I have three options:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Do nothing and connect with Hospice.</li>
      <li>Take an oral chemo pill, called Xeloda, which can sometimes shrink tumors but will never make them go away completely.  This could buy a few extra months of time, but it is not curative.</li>
      <li>Participate in another clinical trial (I no longer qualify for the Tap-Immune vaccine since my disease has progressed).  This trial uses Xeloda for everyone, and then 2 out of 3 randomized patients get an additional experimental drug through an IV.  You don’t know going in which group you will be in. This also can buy a few extra months of time, but it is not curative, either.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>I read the list Dr. Graff gave me which described the side effects for Xeloda and for the experimental drug, and they make my previous chemo rounds (which were horrible) look like a walk in the park. The main side effects are extreme nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea (all of which can be severe enough to cause hospitalization), dehydration, hair loss, fever, fatigue, insomnia, and hand/foot syndrome, where the skin peels off your soles and palms and can impede walking and using your hands.</p>
    <p>All of this suffering for a few extra months? What about quality of life?</p>
    <p>I can’t do it.</p>
    <p>Last fall during chemo, I was praying to die in my sleep because I was in so much pain. I begged Dr. Graff to let me stop Rounds 5 and 6 but she insisted that I do it.  I have been battling Triple Negative Breast Cancer now for 4 years and it is a formidable opponent. I have used up every ounce of courage and bravery that I have.  Each trip to the doctor, to the lab, and every scan I go to causes me extreme anxiety.  It is impossible to describe what it is like living with the possibility of cancer recurrence.</p>
    <p>I have now sat in an office and heard the devastating words, “You have cancer,” three different times.</p>
    <p>I have tried to fight back and endure everything I could for a cure:  10 cycles of powerful chemo, 3 major surgeries, 4 minor surgeries to install and remove the chemo port catheter, and 58 rounds of radiation.  I have been poisoned, cut, and had my skin burned black and cracking open from radiation. I have been bald for
two years. I have to wear $6000 prosthetics that hurt me. I have passed out from chemo-induced stomach cramps and nausea.  My veins are so damaged from chemo that getting a blood draw now requires multiple nurses and multiple sticks.  I have insomnia.  I have fatigue.  I have peripheral neuropathy (numbness) in my hands and feet from chemo, and lymphedema in my right arm, which is painful and sometimes swells from my shoulder to my elbow.  All of this treatment has come with great physical, emotional, and financial cost.
</p>
<p>And so far, none of it has worked.</p>
<p>You may have guessed where I am going with this.  I have chosen Option A: Hospice Care.  There is a wonderful place called KC Hospice House (just on the Missouri side, on Wornall Road) which Dr. Graff recommended.  Fortunately, it is within-network for our health insurance.  It is a stand-alone building (not tucked in a wing of a nursing home) which is dedicated to Hospice Care only.  The facility is beautiful and peaceful.  Dr. Graff is confident that I will receive good care there, and she will continue to manage my case, since she has a palliative care certification and can continue to take care of her terminal patients like me. </p>
<p>Kelly and I will connect with Hospice soon. Right now Dr. Graff said their role will only be a business card on my refrigerator.  Hospice care will start with occasional home visits and increase as needed.  They can provide a hospital bed and
other medical equipment in our home as needed. They provide counseling and social services to the family.  I actually do not want to die at home—that seems so sad to me.  I would prefer to be in the hospice facility when the time comes, so that is my plan.
</p>
<p>I told Dr. Graff that I am not afraid to be dead.  I have faith and I know I will go to heaven and be with Jesus.  But I am terribly afraid of pain, suffering, and dying a horrible death.  She assured me that the pain can be managed.  Basically, as the
end nears, the choice for the patient is comfort vs. clarity.  If you want comfort, then the palliative care drugs are increased, but you will be very sleepy and not be
able to talk with your loved ones.  If you want clarity, then the drugs are decreased, and you can have more lucid conversations.  The nurses can dial the meds up or down as requested.  Knowing this helps me deal with the fear of breathlessness and pain that will come.  Although my diagnosis is devastating to me, I am very much at peace about my ending point at Hospice.
</p>
<p>A few other thoughts:</p>
<p><b>2nd opinions:</b>  Two different radiologists viewed my x-rays.  A third viewed my CT scan.  It’s terminal.  I could go to another cancer center but I will get the same treatment options. There is no cure. I never had a good prognosis from the start, so I am very thankful for the last four years I got to spend with my own family and extended family.  I got to see both of my children graduate from college, get married to wonderful people, and see Emily graduate from PT school and sing at her own pinning ceremony. I got the privilege of teaching the “littles” at school, and help put our kids through college.  I have thoroughly enjoyed these “empty nest” years with Kelly, and we had so much fun on our June vacation—the first one in years, and the first one on our own in many years.  Those have all been wonderful, wonderful gifts.</p>
  <p><b>Other clinical trials/new cures:</b>  Dr. Graff thinks we are still about 10 years out from a cure for TNBC.  I can join a clinical trial at any time if I change my mind, or even start the Xeloda for the duration.  For me, quality of life is huge, and I am SO. OVER. CHEMO. and its dehumanizing side effects.  I feel pretty good now, and I want to keep it that way as long as possible.</p>
  <p><b>Paperwork:</b>  I am getting my affairs in order.  There are lots of helpful lists on Google.  It is keeping me very busy right now.</p>
  <p><b>Job:</b> I am resigning from my teaching position this week.</p>
  <p><b>House:</b>  Yes, it is ironic that we are building our new house for our empty nest years.  We will continue as planned, and Kelly will stay there after I am gone.  Everything I need is on the main level, and it will be smaller and less maintenance for us, so it will be good during this transition.  We close on November 9.</p>
  <p><b>Expiration Date:</b> “A year or so”—it is too soon to tell.  The doctors will know better as the disease progresses.  TNBC patients are in the sooner rather than later category. </p>
  <p>It makes me so sad to write this, as you know how much I prefer to bring a smile to your faces rather than tears.  I know this is all way too much information, but it saves me many painful conversations which I cannot handle yet. </p>
  <p>I want to enjoy these last months and days and keep things positive, rather than spend them mourning.  The thing that makes me the saddest is missing out on the rest of life that will continue on without me…spending time with my grown-up children, playing with my grandchildren, a peaceful happy life with my wonderful husband, and visits with my parents and extended family.  I can’t wrap my brain around that yet, and I am not sure I ever will.  When I get sad, I just remember “Jesus Loves Me.”  That was the first song I ever learned in church and it’s a good one.</p>
  <p>I love you all.  Please keep me in your prayers. </p>

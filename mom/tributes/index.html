    <h1>Tributes to Julia</h1>
    <p>Julia has always been a source of joy. When she was four or five weeks old, Max would hold her on his lap after her morning feeding while he read for exams. One morning there was a thud on the back of the book. Then another. She was kicking down the barrier. Then there was her first sighting of a hippo at the Kansas City Zoo.  At a year old, her eyes widened. “HippoMOpotamus!” We still call them that. When she was six, she saw her grandpa had missed a button on his cardigan. She started fixing it. “Grandpa, here’s how we do it.” She could do voices. Any voices. One time, Max had to pull into a stranger’s driveway because everyone was laughing so hard he couldn’t drive. And she married a man known as Dr. Fun. We give thanks for her every day of our lives. - <b>Max & Claire Sutton</b>, <i>Parents of Julia</i></p>
    <p>The Rauckman family has been weaving a tapestry for 57 years and Julia was a big part of our art design. Although not the leader, Julia was supportive of whatever was going on for family fun and togetherness. She was a woman of God, devoted to Kelly, intentional in her mothering, artistic, creative, organized, loved to laugh at all the cousin antics, normally had a camera in hand to capture the fun, congenial, witty, smart and always a happy participant. We have four photo albums as proof of our togetherness. There were "Julia" foods that she would bring for our delight, and espinaca coupons in her possession for Jose Peppers. If you turn over the tapestry you would find some broken threads in our lives repaired by forgiveness, resolving differences, making better choices, or living through hard situations. God has done the weaving and for that we are blessed and hope that future generations will taste the fruit of what we hold dear. - <b>Kathy Rauckman</b>, <i>Mother-in-law of Julia</i></p>
    <p>She was honestly the kindest person I knew. She was genuine, peaceful, creative and witty, not to mention, completely committed to loving and serving her family and friends. When Owen and I came along, she made the decision to stay home with us until we were older. She was a listener; I could talk to her about everything, and she would always know the right words to say. She was a giver; she never asked for anything, and poured her love, time and energy into my well-being. She was an educator; every opportunity was a learning opportunity. She was festive; holidays were always filled with decorations, delicious food, little gifts and sweet gestures. She was a beautiful musician; she inspired me to challenge myself as a pianist and vocalist. She was dedicated; she never missed any of my recitals, concerts, meets or events. She was soft-spoken, although she had a twinkle in her eye, a contagious smile and such passion that made the world seem brighter. She set an example for me in the way that she loved and served my dad unconditionally. She was a woman of faith. Julia Rauckman was my mom, and for that I am grateful...more than my words can express. She is no longer suffering. I am fully confident that she has entered the Kingdom of God, where she is experiencing the joys of eternal life with our Amazing Creator.  - <b>Emily Pemble</b>, <i>Daughter of Julia</i></p>
    <p>My mom was the kindest, most caring person. I can’t really summarize how loving she was in a paragraph, but this story might help illustrate her character: I had surgery a few years ago about same time she was going through her first round of Chemo. We spent a summer recovering together in the living room. Me on the couch, her in the recliner. My surgery was pretty minor, but being a knucklehead college student I spent a lot of time complaining. My mom was told that she may only have a few years left to live, she was dealing with the awful side-effects of chemotherapy, and she was embarrassed that her hair was falling out, but she never complained. She was fatigued but still spent her precious energy taking care of me and comforting me when I was in pain or upset. I was selfish, I couldn’t step back and realize that what she was going through was much worse than my problems. Looking back I can’t even begin to understand how she could have been so selfless. How could someone be such a servant even though they were suffering? My mom cared so much for people. She always put in the extra effort to enhance the lives of those around her. Whether that be spending a full Saturday collecting the biggest Pinecones in the park so that her first grade students could do a fun art project, or baking for hours so that her family members could have all of their favorite treats on their birthdays. I’ll miss you Mom. I’ll miss seeing your warm smile and hearing your encouraging words, but most of all I’ll miss spending time with you. <b>Owen Rauckman</b>, <i>Son of Julia</i></p>
